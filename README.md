3D Visualization of Ioannina 🌍
Ioannina 3D Visualization

Overview ℹ️
This project is a senior thesis developed using Unity and C# for creating a 3D visualization of Ioannina and its surrounding areas. The virtual world is built using geotiff files to incorporate detailed geographic and weather information, providing a highly accurate and realistic visualization. The integration of the Unity engine and geotiff files is achieved through C# programming.
