My 3D visualization project of Ioannina is a senior thesis that I developed using Unity. It
creates a virtual world of Ioannina and the surrounding areas, utilizing geotiff files for detailed
geographic and weather information, which enhances the accuracy and realism of the
visualization. I used C# programming to integrate the Unity engine and geotiff files. Through
this project, I was able to demonstrate my skills in Unity and C# programming, as well as my
ability to work with geospatial data.
